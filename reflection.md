What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Both classes were pretty easy to do. The hardest part was to figure out what functions should the classes have. I had some sonfusion with how to Commit changes to github but one I figured out how to turn on autosave, everything else was pretty easy. Since I'm used to other programing languages, Python was a bit confusing and it took me a little time to remember how to use it. To someone taking this cource in the future, I would asvise to start with writting classes and try testing their functions as soon as possible. I would also advise to figure out how github works before starting the project.
